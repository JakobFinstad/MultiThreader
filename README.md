# MultiThreader
## How to start

Launch the main function after compiling, then open postman and send a request to the port 8080.

## Multithreader vs SingelThreader mode
To switch between the multithreader and the singel threader, change the field variable in the main class to true.

## Some extras
Mark that the http respons will allways say SingelThreader server when it replyes, even when multithreader mode is on.
The multithreader will not write in the times in the consol, and the multithreader waits for only 5 seconds instead of 10.
